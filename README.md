Roman Numerals
==============
When learning C# I used a popular coding kata called Roman Numerals. This kata is completed using C# and is tested with NUnit.
Specification
-------------
This program is designed to translate any given arabic number in the range from 1 to 999 to a corresponding Roman Numeral. The Romans wrote numbers using letters, the following correspondence is the key to the Roman Numerals: 1 = I, 5 = V, 10 = X, 50 = L, 100 = C, 500 = D, 1000 = M

Languages and Tools
-------------------
* C#
* NUnit

Use Visual Studio or MonoDevelop options to run the unit tests or run the solution to see the Roman Numerals for numbers from 1 to 99.
